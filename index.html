            <h1>ANDAMAN AND NICOBAR ISLANDS</h1>
            <h2><em><strong>My travel experience</strong></em></h2>

            <ol>
                <h4><li>Cellular jail</h4>
                    <p class="j">The Cellular Jail, also known as Kālā Pānī (Hindi for black waters), was a colonial prison in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, India. The prison was used by the British for the express purpose of exiling political prisoners to the remote archipelago. Many notable independence activists, including Batukeshwar Dutt, Yogendra Shukla, and Vinayak Savarkar were imprisoned here during the struggle for India's independence. Today, the complex serves as a national memorial monument</p>

                    Havelock island</h4>
                    <p class="j">Havelock Island is one of the primary destinations of Andaman and Nicobar Islands. It is famed for its pristine beauty that goes unmatched when it comes to untouched and unexplored natural beauty and virgin forests of earth. It is a striking contrast of verdant greenery, sandy whiteness and blue vast ocean body. Due to its more than fair share of popularity among tourists and travelers, Havelock has developed luxurious tourist resorts and hotels to pamper the guests living in the lap of intense natural beauty. Havelock is the largest of islands and falls under must-visit destinations. A tour to Andamans would definitely be incomplete without a visit to the Elephant Beach and Radhanagar Beach of Havelock Island. The sublime beauty of the Radhanagar Beach combines with its perfect setting spread against the primitive jungles. The background is filled with a thousand sounds of jungle animals and birds and the secluded beach has “Beware of Crocodiles” marked at places. These factors make Radhanagar Beach one of the most coveted destinations of not only Andamans, also of world.<br>

                        Snorkelling and scuba diving at Havelock under the aegis of expert trainers can turn into a lifetime experience. Watch the myriad sea creatures, some still and some moving, some peeping and some hiding, some iridescent and some camouflaged, some in groups of thousands and some single and solitary guarding protected corners of shelter. Each lap ahead as you swim through with the sea animals brings you face to face with a new wonder.</p>
